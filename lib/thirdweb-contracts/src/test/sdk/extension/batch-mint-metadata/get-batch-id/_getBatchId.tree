_getBatchId(uint256 _tokenId)
├── when `_tokenId` doesn't belong to any batch, i.e. greater than the last batchId
  │  └── it should revert ✅
  └── when `_tokenId` belongs to some batch, i.e. less than that batchId
          └── it should return correct batchId and batch index for the `_tokenId` ✅
(note: all batches are assumed to be contiguous, i.e. start id of one batch is the end id of the previous batch)
